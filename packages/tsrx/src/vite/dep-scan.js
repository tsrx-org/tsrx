/**
 * Rolldown plugins that make `.tsrx` modules visible to Vite's dependency
 * scanner.
 *
 * The scanner runs through Rolldown without the main plugin pipeline, so on its
 * own it cannot read `.tsrx` modules. Any npm dependency imported only from
 * `.tsrx` files is then discovered at request time rather than at startup,
 * which forces a re-optimize and a full page reload. Registering one of these
 * under `optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions.plugins` teaches the scan pass to compile
 * `.tsrx` modules so their imports are crawled up front.
 *
 * Which factory to use depends on how the host plugin exposes `.tsrx` modules:
 *
 * - {@link createDepScanTransformPlugin} for plugins that transform `.tsrx`
 *   ids directly. Those plugins must also list the extension in
 *   `optimizeDeps.extensions`, because the scanner externalizes anything that
 *   is not a known JS type before a plugin gets a chance to run.
 * - {@link createDepScanLoadPlugin} for plugins that rewrite `.tsrx` ids to a
 *   virtual `<path>.tsx` form. The scanner accepts those on extension alone, so
 *   no `optimizeDeps.extensions` entry is needed, but it never calls Vite
 *   `load()` hooks for virtual ids.
 *
 * Both swallow compile failures. Vite responds to a scan error by skipping
 * pre-bundling for the whole project, so a single malformed file would
 * otherwise cost every other dependency its pre-bundle. Handing back an empty
 * module keeps the rest of the graph crawlable and leaves the error to the host
 * plugin's own transform, which reports it at request time where it can be
 * surfaced properly.
 *
