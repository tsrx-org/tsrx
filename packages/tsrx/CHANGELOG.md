  [`d23290e`](https://github.com/tsrx-org/tsrx/commit/d23290e3aba3ed52e620571e26180bb8561f0fd1)
  Thanks [@chenzylab](https://github.com/chenzylab)! - Fix `@for` misparsing its
  own body when nested directly inside an `@if` branch and containing another
  control-flow directive (`@if`, `@if`/`@else`, or a nested `@for`). `parseBlock`
  previously gated the TSRX-aware control-flow block parser on both
  `#isNativeTemplateNode(parent)` and `#templateControlFlowBlockDepth > 0`, but an
  `@if`'s own body-parsing empties the parser's internal path stack while
  tokenizing its body as code, so `#isNativeTemplateNode` saw an empty stack and
  returned `false` even though `#templateControlFlowBlockDepth` correctly signaled
  the nested `@for`'s body. The `@for`'s body then fell through to plain statement
  parsing, which wrapped the inner directive in a bare `ExpressionStatement`
  around a synthetic JSXFragment instead of producing a proper
  `JSXIfExpression`/`JSXForExpression`/etc. Printers with no `JSXFragment` visitor
  (such as esrap's `ts` language, used for Ripple's SSR-target output) then failed
  with `Not implemented: JSXFragment` when serializing that node; other
  JSX-runtime targets were unaffected since they don't route through that printer.

  markup text as a literal character when it cannot start a tag, so
  `<span><3</span>` parses instead of throwing `Unexpected token`. The JSX printer

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - fix: stop dropping TypeScript
  modifiers when formatting

  Formatting silently rewrote what the source declared. `readonly` was dropped
  from interface and type-literal members, turning `readonly id: number` into a
  mutable `id: number`; `abstract` was dropped from classes and their members (and
  abstract methods gained an empty body, making them concrete); and `declare`,
  `override`, `accessor`, accessor kinds on method signatures (`get`/`set`),
  `abstract new`, `declare global` (printed as `declare module global`), computed
  keys, class static blocks, and constructor parameter properties were dropped or
  mangled the same way.

  All of these now round-trip, and `@tsrx/core`'s AST types carry the class
  modifiers the printer needs.

- [#1406](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1406)
  [`5e4b38e`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/5e4b38ec26c8268b60e3ca4319eb37f8a07b3078)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - fix: stop dropping decorators
  when formatting

  The printer had no decorator handling at all, so formatting silently deleted
  every `@decorator` in a `.tsrx` file — on class declarations, methods, fields,
  accessors, and parameters alike. Decorators have runtime effects, so this
  changed what the code did.

  All four positions now round-trip, following prettier's line breaking: class
  decorators each take their own line, class member decorators keep the lines they
  were written with (and an inline decorator too long to share the member's line
  moves to its own), and parameter decorators stay inline. Decorators on an
  exported class print above the `export` keyword, and a parameter property's
  decorators print before its modifiers. `@tsrx/core`'s AST types now carry the
  `Decorator` node the printer needs.

- [#1409](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1409)
  [`7136920`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/7136920028537f336c9404493d8c9fde80105408)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - fix: terminate expression
  default exports, and print anonymous default-exported functions

  `export default <expression>` is a statement and needs a `;`, but the printer
  only emitted one for the parenthesized class and function expressions handled in
  the previous fix. Every other expression form lost its terminator:
  `export default foo;` was formatted to `export default foo`.

  That is an ASI hazard, not a cosmetic difference. The following line is pulled
  into the exported expression whenever it starts with `(`, `[`, a template
  literal, `+`, `-`, or `/`, so

  ```ts
  export default foo;
  (function () {})();
  ```

  was reformatted into the single call `export default foo(function () {})()`.

  The terminator is now decided by whether the export is a declaration or an
  expression. The declaration forms — `class`, `function`, `interface`, an
  overload signature, and the decorated `export default @dec class Named {}` that
  parses as a `ClassExpression` — still end at their closing brace.

  Separately, `export default function () {}` crashed the printer. It is the one
  position where a `FunctionDeclaration` may be anonymous, and the printer read
  the name unconditionally. Anonymous default-exported functions, async functions,
  and generators now print.

  `@tsrx/core` gains `TSRXExportDefaultDeclaration`, which models the two
  TypeScript-only declaration forms the parser puts in that slot —
  `export default interface Foo {}` and `export default function foo();` — that
  estree's `ExportDefaultDeclaration` does not.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix a parse error for `as`
  casts around parenthesized JSX in attribute values
  (`prop={((c) => (<Col />)) as any}`). The after-element context fixup popped a

  container's brace and the `as` tokenized as a JSX name instead of starting the

  multi-line JSX elements with element children used as attribute values
  (`prop={<div><span>x</span></div>}`), including nested paired elements and
  sibling elements after a nested close. The tokenizer's stale-text fixups counted
  contexts against the whole stack, which is blind inside a `{ … }` container;
  they now scope the count to the container so each still-open element keeps the
  children context its own closing tag pops.

## 0.1.51

### Patch Changes

- [#1394](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1394)
  [`6404d3c`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/6404d3cc679fde2eb83ec85c9cd98b653f3f2fed)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - fix: make `.tsrx` imports
  visible to Vite's dependency scanner in every plugin

  Vite's dep scanner runs through Rolldown without the main plugin pipeline, so
  any npm dependency imported only from `.tsrx` files was invisible at startup and
  got discovered at request time instead, forcing a re-optimize and a full page
  reload. Only `@tsrx/vite-plugin-react` handled this; `@tsrx/vite-plugin-preact`,
  `@tsrx/vite-plugin-solid` and `@ripple-ts/vite-plugin` now do too.

  `@tsrx/core` gains a `@tsrx/core/vite/dep-scan` entry point with the two plugin
  shapes this needs: `createDepScanTransformPlugin` for plugins that transform
  `.tsrx` ids directly, and `createDepScanLoadPlugin` for plugins that rewrite
  them to a virtual `<path>.tsx` form. Both swallow compile failures, so a single
  malformed file no longer costs the whole project its dependency pre-bundling.

  Also fixes the scan's own JSX transform, which defaults to React's automatic
  runtime. It was emitting an unresolvable `react/jsx-dev-runtime` import into
  Preact, Solid and Vue projects, which failed the scan outright — the React-only
  form of this bug appeared when `jsxImportSource` was set to a non-React runtime.
  The React and Preact plugins now point that transform at the configured import
  source, and the Solid and Vue plugins leave JSX untransformed during the scan
  since their own JSX stage runs downstream.

  [`6025176`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/6025176000cafa50d924add8e9a878fe37c0c22b)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - fix(parser): recognize
  control-flow directives inside element-valued attribute expressions

  JSX inside an attribute-value `{ … }` container now parses through the TSRX
  template path, so `prop={<h1>@if (ok) { … } @else { … }</h1>}` behaves the same
  as assigning the element to a variable first. Previously the directive was
  either kept as literal text or — when no whitespace preceded the `@` — re-parsed
  into an untransformed directive node that crashed the printer.

  Also fixes template text loss around directives: text (and significant inline
  whitespace) preceding a directive or an `=` was silently dropped in
  container-nested elements, and inline spaces between a sibling element and a
  directive were dropped inside `@switch` bodies and value-position directives
  (`const v = @if …`). Sibling whitespace now survives uniformly, matching how the
  browser renders it; newline-containing layout indentation is still removed.

- [#1389](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1389)
  [`7ad580e`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/7ad580efd24b338b4774add06afdcdd8876c954c)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - chore(types): type the parser
  plugin without `any`

  Every `any` cast in the acorn plugin is gone, and the type declarations it was
  papering over now describe what the parser actually produces:
  `jsx_parseOpeningElementAt` returns `TSRXJSXOpeningElement | JSXOpeningFragment`
  instead of the plain `JSXOpeningElement` it never emits for `<>` or a dynamic
  `<{expr}>` tag, `TSRXJSXFragment` carries the loose-mode `unclosed` flag, and
  `TSRXJSXClosingElement` carries the `isDynamic` flag both halves of a dynamic
  tag get. `@sveltejs/acorn-typescript`'s `tsTryParseAndCatch` and
  `tsParseTypeArgumentsInExpression` are declared on the parser interface, and the
  in-place node retypes (statement to `JSX*Expression` directive, opening/closing
  element to fragment, the under-construction template node's discriminant and
  opening/closing slots) go through named views in the types package. Parser
  behavior is unchanged.

- [#1391](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1391)
  [`6eaa2f3`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/6eaa2f3e6cd18973d57df06eae770313dd061a1a)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Replace every `any` in
  `@tsrx/solid`, `@tsrx/vue`, `@tsrx/react` and `@tsrx/preact` with the real AST,
  compiler and framework types, and move each package's `@typedef` blocks into its
  `types/` declarations.

  `@tsrx/solid`'s transform carried the bulk of it: all 126 `any` annotations are
  gone, replaced by the parser's AST types plus a new `types/transform.d.ts`
  describing the shapes the Solid lowering passes around (`SolidRenderSource`,
  `SolidIfBranch`, `SolidLoweredList`, `SolidBranchArrow`, …).
  `is_solid_render_child` and `is_branch_arrow` are now type predicates,
  `to_jsx_child` declares that a render source always lowers to a JSX child, and
  the hand-built `JSXElement`/`JSXAttribute` object literals are built through the
  shared builders instead — so generated attributes carry the `shorthand` field
  the type requires. The two places where a statement list is still mid-lowering
  go through `lowered_block`/`lowered_switch_case`, which name that invariant
  instead of hiding it behind `any`. Three unreachable helpers
  (`get_if_consequent_body`, `negate_expression`, `TEMPLATE_FRAGMENT_ERROR`) were
  dropped.

  `@tsrx/vue`'s error boundary no longer casts the `vue` namespace to `any` at
  every call: the Vapor renderer's runtime-internal helpers are declared once in
  `types/vapor-runtime.d.ts` (`VaporRuntime`, `VaporBlock`, `VaporFragment`,
  `VaporComponentInstance`), the namespace is narrowed to that interface a single
  time, and `EffectScope` comes from `vue`'s own published export.
  `TsrxErrorBoundaryProps` describes its render callbacks as returning `unknown`
  rather than `any`, matching what the boundary actually does with them.

  The React and Preact error boundaries declare their props and state through
  `TsrxErrorBoundaryProps`/`TsrxErrorBoundaryState` instead of an `any`
  constructor parameter, Preact's `CompileOptions` typedef moved from
  `src/transform.js` to `types/index.d.ts` where the declaration already lived,
  and all four `compile` entry points return the shared `CompileResult` (a typed
  `map`) instead of an inline shape with `map: any`.

  `@tsrx/core`'s `BaseNodeMetaData` declares the two flags Solid's transform sets
  (`solid_render_control`, `is_branch_arrow`), alongside the Vue-specific flags
  already there.

  [`9ffd4ba`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/9ffd4ba3e5982acb79a02efe0379abdc14c092a1)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Replace every `any` in
  `@tsrx/core` with the real AST, CSS, parser and runtime types, move all
  remaining `@typedef` blocks into the package's `types/` declarations, and
  typecheck `packages/tsrx/tests` alongside `src` and `types`.

  Public type declarations gained accuracy along the way: `TSModuleDeclaration.id`
  accepts a string literal, `TSModuleBlock.body` allows imports and exports,
  `AnalysisResult` declares its `module` field,
  `ImportDeclaration`/`ImportExpression` declare their legacy
  `assertions`/`arguments` slots, `Program` declares `tsrx_keyword_tokens`, and
  `zimmerframe`'s `walk` plus esrap's `print`/`tsx` are generic over their state
  instead of `any`. New builders (`ts_qualified_name`, `ts_import_equals`,
  `assignment_prop`) and shared helpers (`node_children`, `is_style_element`)
  replace hand-built nodes and duplicated predicates.

  The published runtime declarations keep their reach: `normalize_spread_props`,
  `normalize_spread_props_for_ref_attr` and `exclude_prop_from_object` accept any
  object — an interface- or class-typed props bag included — rather than only an
  index-signature type, and `exclude_prop_from_object` now returns `Omit<T, K>` so
  the surviving props stay readable. `create_ref_prop` and `apply_ref_value` now
  resolve their node type through a `RefTarget` overload that mirrors the
  runtime's own resolution order, so a ref to an element carrying a `value`
  property (`input`, `button`, `select`, `textarea`, `option`, `li`, `progress`,
  `meter`, `output`, `data`) resolves to the element instead of to `string`.
  Type-level tests pin the inferred types of every published ref and language
  helper, so a signature change that degrades editor completion fails a test.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Add shared TSRX semantic
  analysis and report free-floating template output in normal function bodies and
  ordinary setup sections of `@{}` blocks. Runtime builds now fail when output
  would be discarded, while type-only and Volar compilation collect the diagnostic
  and continue. Return or retain template values, or make them part of a

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Add an opt-in
  `platform.serverModule` descriptor to `createJsxTransform`: in typeOnly output,
  a platform's file-local `module <blockName> { … }` server-module dialect and its
  boundary `import { x } from '<importSpecifier>'` statements are lowered to plain
  checkable TS (block imports hoisted, the block lowered to a namespace keeping
  the authored name, boundary imports lowered to destructures / `type` aliases,
  colliding hoisted locals aliased through a mangled namespace import). Verbatim,
  the dialect can never typecheck (TS1147 in-block import, TS2307 boundary
  import). Platforms without the option, and all runtime/build output, are
  untouched. The namespace references derived from the authored `'server'`
  specifier map its inner span with hover/navigation but WITHOUT semantic tokens,
  so the specifier keeps its string syntax highlighting instead of being partially
  repainted as a namespace token.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Treat `<script>…</script>` as
  a raw-text element (like `<style>`) so its body can contain real JS/TS —
  including markup-significant characters such as `<`, `{`, and `}` — instead of
  being parsed as template markup. The body is captured verbatim on the element's
  `content`.

  Editors now get embedded TypeScript intellisense inside `<script>` bodies
  (type-aware completions, hover, go-to-definition, and diagnostics), mapped back
  to the `.tsrx` source — the same way `<style>` bodies get embedded CSS. Every
  body is treated as TypeScript in the editor (a superset of JavaScript); the
  `type` attribute only matters to the runtime transforms. This works across all
  tsrx targets, since the parser and compiler changes live in shared core and the
  language server is target-neutral.

  The compiler emits a new `scriptMappings` array on `VolarMappingsResult`, and
  every target renders the inline raw-text `<script>` body verbatim (the parser
  mirrors the body as a text child for generic element paths; the Ripple client
  and server inject it as the script's text content). The Prettier plugin formats
  the body as JavaScript/TypeScript in a block layout, the same way `<style>`
  bodies are formatted as CSS.

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Fixed the tokenizer reading `/`
  and `#` as literal template-text characters in JS positions nested under a
  template element: division in a nested element's attribute expression
  (`<g><rect x={a - b / 2} /></g>`), division and private-field access in child
  expression containers (`{a / 2}`, `{this.#x}`), and division in control-flow
  directive headers (`@if (a / 2 > 1)`) all mis-parsed as "Unexpected token". The
  text special-case now skips expression containers and directive headers, where
  acorn's own tokenizer handles division vs regex correctly; literal `/` and `#`
  in template text are unchanged.

  with nested children inside a ternary branch of an expression container (e.g.
  `{cond ? (<Outer><Inner>hi</Inner></Outer>) : null}` spread across lines) no
  longer fails to parse. After the closing `)`, the tokenizer treated the

  it; raw text inside an expression container is now only read when the innermost
  template element was opened inside that container.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Keep single-text template
  output faithful to the source instead of promoting it to a string-literal
  expression. A component or fragment whose only output is a text node (e.g.
  `<>@</>` or `<>Hello</>`) is now emitted as-is in both the editor (type-only)
  view and runtime codegen, rather than being rewritten to `{'@'}` / `{'Hello'}`.
  This fixes valid text characters like `@` being mangled and preserves source
  fidelity/mappings across all targets. Nullish or whitespace-only single-text
  output now renders nothing at runtime instead of emitting a stray empty-string
  expression.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix a parser crash when a
  template literal is the first thing in a `@{ … }` code block: `let c = @{`123`}`
  (and `@{ `${x}` }`) threw "Unterminated template" while `@{ '123' }` parsed
  fine. The code block's opening brace reads the next token ahead, and a template
  literal's backtick pushes its own tokenizer context; the setup-statement parser
  then shadowed (or stranded, after a prior statement) that context, so the
  template body tokenized as ordinary code and never closed. The backtick is now
  detected so the template-literal context stays on top and the body parses
  correctly.

- [#1292](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1292)
  [`35ac700`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/35ac70052d79efae41bb1df2440fee3f052ca115)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Allow a
  `@if`/`@for`/`@switch`/`@try` control-flow directive or a `@{ … }` code block to
  be combined into an expression (React, Preact, Solid, Vue, and Ripple), instead
  of crashing the printer with "Not implemented: JSX…Expression" or leaking a bare
  `if (…) { … }` into expression position.

  A directive combined into an expression — an operator operand
  (`const ad = (@if (…) { … }) || 'fallback'`), a conditional branch, a `@for`
  iterable, an `@if`/`@switch` test — is now wrapped so it lives inside a
  fragment. For the JSX targets the directive is wrapped in a `<> … </>` (kept as
  the truthy fragment value in an operand position, collapsed to its rendered
  value in a "raw value" slot). For Ripple the directive is wrapped before
  normalization, so the client and server lower it to a `_$_.tsrx_element(…)`
  render (the control flow runs inside the render callback) and the `to_ts` output
  keeps the `<> … </>` for its TSX type view.

  For Ripple the wrap covers a directive used in ANY value position, not just
  operators: the sole value of a slot (`let cd = @if (…) { … }`,
  `cd = @switch (…) { … }`, `render(@if (…) { … })`), a concise arrow body
  (`xs.map((x) => @if (x) { … })`), a `return` argument inside a nested function,
  a member object, and so on — all previously leaked a bare `if (…) { … }`
  statement in some or all modes. The positions where a directive is already
  lowered correctly (render children, statements, `@if` branches, a `@{ … }` code
  block's render output) are left untouched. A `@{ … }` code block self-lowers to
  an IIFE in every position and is never wrapped (so it is not redundantly
  fragment-wrapped in, e.g., an array element). The JSX targets already collapse a
  sole-value directive to its rendered value, so they are unchanged.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Keep an empty expression

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Keep empty fragments in

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Keep an authored `<> … </>`
  fragment verbatim in EVERY position, instead of unwrapping a single-child
  fragment to its bare child (React, Preact, Solid, Vue, and Ripple `to_ts`).

  Previously a single-child fragment was collapsed — `const v = <>{1}</>` became
  `const v = 1`, `return <>{x}</>` became `return x`, and
  `@if (cond()) { <>{'Hi'}</> }` became `cond() ? 'Hi' : null` — turning the
  author's JSX into a plain value and changing its meaning (a fragment is always a
  truthy element and has a different type, so collapsing can produce the wrong
  output). Authored fragments are now kept everywhere:
  - value positions: a variable initializer, an assignment, an operator operand, a
    conditional branch, an array element, a call argument;
  - render output: a component's `<> … </>` render, a `return <>…</>`, an arrow
    body `() => <>…</>`;
  - the branches of an `@if`/`@for`/`@switch`/`@try` (`@if (c) { <>{'Hi'}</> }` →
    `c ? <>{'Hi'}</> : null`, `@for (…) { <>{x}</> }` → `… => <>{x}</>`);
  - Ripple `to_ts` additionally keeps a fragment in a JSX-child `{ … }` container
    slot (`<div>{<>{x}</>}</div>`), matching the JS targets.

  An empty authored `<></>` is also kept verbatim everywhere — `return <></>`
  stays `return <></>` (not `null`) on all targets.

  A compiler-generated wrapper fragment (the one added around a control-flow
  directive so it lowers to a value) is marked internally and still collapses, so
  `const x = @switch (…) { … }` is unchanged. A nested authored fragment collapses
  outer→inner (`<><>{x}</></>` → `<>{x}</>`) — still a fragment, so no wrong
  output. A `<style>` inside a fragment is still collected and scoped (the re-wrap
  operates on the already style-stripped value). Ripple's client/server runtime
  output is unaffected (it renders fragments via `tsrx_element`).

  [`35ac700`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/35ac70052d79efae41bb1df2440fee3f052ca115)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Keep a `<> … </>` fragment
  that is combined into an expression as a fragment, instead of collapsing its
  single child to a bare value (React, Preact, Solid, Vue, and Ripple `to_ts`).

  A fragment is always a truthy element, but its single child may be falsy, so
  unwrapping `<>{0}</>` to `0` flipped the meaning of `<>{0}</> || 'default'` from
  rendering `0` to rendering `'default'`. When a fragment is the operand of an
  operator, a conditional branch, an array element, or another combined
  expression, the fragment is now preserved. The existing collapse is unchanged
  for a fragment that is the sole value of a render-output slot (a `return`, a
  variable initializer, an arrow body, a call argument), where it only renders and
  the collapse is invisible.

- [#1298](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1298)
  [`2b65285`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/2b65285bfcd4c6a0aa93d7fa0b25082e6ec74e1f)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Apply lazy `&{ … }` /
  `&[ … ]` destructuring inside nested `@{ … }` code blocks and `@if` / `@for` /
  `@switch` / `@try` directive bodies (React, Preact, Solid, and Vue production
  output), instead of leaving the lazy declaration as a plain destructure while
  its references go unrewritten.

  These scopes lower to compiler-generated function boundaries — scoped IIFEs,
  `.map(...)` callbacks, and `<Show>` / `<For>` / `<Match>` render closures — that
  did not exist when `has_lazy_descendants` was first stamped, so the lazy
  transform's fast-path skipped them. The descendant flag is now re-derived over
  the fully lowered tree before the transform runs, so a `let &{ name } = props`
  declared in a nested block or directive body is rewritten to
  `let __lazy0 = props` + `__lazy0.name` exactly as it is in a flat component
  body. A `@switch` case body's lazy bindings are now collected too (the shared
  switch block scope), so a reference like `{value}` becomes `{__lazy0.value}`
  rather than a half-transformed `let __lazy0 = props` with a dangling `value`.

  Also rewrite a lazy binding used as a JSX element/component name to a member
  expression (`function Comp(&{ Item }) @{ <Item></Item> }` →
  `function Comp(__lazy0) { return <__lazy0.Item></__lazy0.Item>; }`). The bound
  name is no longer a local once the param/declaration is replaced with the
  generated `__lazy0` source, so `<Item>` had been leaking a reference to an
  undefined identifier; it now reads the component off the lazy source like every
  other reference does.

  An untyped lazy object param no longer gets a synthesized `{ … : any }` type.
  The source specified no type, so the generated param is left implicitly `any`
  (`function Comp(__lazy0)`) instead of carrying a fabricated object shape; a
  param with an author-provided type still keeps it
  (`function Comp(__lazy0: Props)`).

  Type-only (virtual TSX) output is unchanged: it never runs the lazy transform,
  so the param keeps printing as a plain destructure (`{ Item }`, untyped) and
  `<Item>` keeps referencing that in-scope binding, which preserves identity-style
  source mappings for editor features.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Skip the wrapper anchor for
  single control-flow / code-block / component root scopes. When a scope's entire
  renderable output is a single `@if`, `@switch`, `@for`, `@try`, or static child
  component — i.e. a component body, a control-flow branch, or a `@{}` body whose
  only output after setup is one of these — the compiler now renders it directly
  before the parent-provided `__anchor` instead of synthesizing a `<!>` fragment
  wrapper and an extra append + clone. For deep recursive trees this measurably
  cuts mount time and shrinks generated output; in the recursive-context benchmark
  it brought mount DOM operations to one clone + one append per element (from
  ~1.5×) and halved the comment-anchor nodes.

  Hydration is preserved. The control-flow runtimes
  (`if_block`/`switch_block`/`for_block`/`for_block_keyed`/`try_block`) capture
  the SSR boundary marker and hand it to `append()` afterward, so the existing
  context-aware cursor advance still runs — including for a root scope used as a
  child of a composite/slot with following siblings. Single-component roots need
  no runtime change at all, since a component's own content advances the hydration
  cursor.

  Also relaxes the compiler's text-expression detection: `string + anything` (e.g.
  `{a + '|' + b}`) is now recognized as text and lowered to the fast `set_text`
  path without requiring an explicit `as string`, since such an expression always
  evaluates to a string in JS.

  from it used to clear _every_ JSX children context — including the parent
  element's own — so the later `text<tag>` sibling tokenized its `<` as a
  relational operator that `parseTemplateBody` has no branch for, recursing
  forever. The recovery now keeps one children context per still-open ancestor

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - fix(parser): keep significant
  whitespace before a `@{ … }` code block

  The native template body skipped leading whitespace when repositioning onto a
  `@{ … }` code block, so `<>   @{<b>123</b>}   </>` lost its leading edge space
  (only the trailing one survived). The whitespace is now emitted as a text child,
  matching the equivalent plain-element case; layout indentation (whitespace
  containing a newline) is still dropped.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix parsing of sibling
  fragments/elements separated by template text. A `<>` or `<tag>` opening that
  follows template text (e.g. `<> <></> 2 <></> </>`) arrives as a relational `<`
  token; the JSX re-entry fallback now pushes the same tokenizer contexts a real
  `jsxTagStart` would, so the terminating `>` — including the lone `>` of a
  nameless fragment — is read as `jsxTagEnd` instead of a relational operator.
  Also preserve an inline space that separates two sibling elements on the same
  line (`<> <></>  <></>x </>`) as significant JSX text; only layout whitespace
  spanning a newline is still collapsed.

  [`cc3176b`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/cc3176b4e40021021986830bdfa3295530715432)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Preserve significant
  whitespace and keep fragments faithful in TSRX template output.
  - Parser: a sibling after a closing tag (`<b>1</b> 2`, `<> <>x</> y <>z</> </>`)
    now reads as JSX text at the source, so significant inline whitespace is kept
    instead of being eaten by `skipSpace`. This fixes the leading space being
    dropped (`" 2 "` not `"2 "`) and removes several closing-tag
    whitespace/context workarounds.
  - Transform: a single-text fragment used as a JSX child stays a fragment
    (`<>123</>` instead of `{'123'}`), and an empty fragment child stays `<></>`
    instead of `{null}`. Expression/return-position single-text fragments still
    lower to a string (`return <>x</>` -> `return "x"`). Whitespace at a
    fragment/element's content edges is wrapped in a `{' '}` container so it
    survives formatting/JSX collapsing; whitespace between siblings stays bare
    (`<b/> <i/>`). The edge rule is shared (`wrapEdgeWhitespace`) across the
    React/Preact/Solid transforms and the Ripple to_ts view.
  - Ripple target: whitespace-only text that is a significant inline space is kept
    rather than dropped, so edge and inter-element spaces survive in client
    templates and SSR output. The to_ts / Volar type-checking view now matches the
    JSX targets — literal text stays bare (not `{"123"}`), single-text fragments
    stay `<>123</>`, empty fragments stay `<></>` (not `{null}`), `{a}` expression
    containers are preserved for type visibility, and edge whitespace prints as
    single-quote `{' '}`.

### Patch Changes

  [`8747e8f`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/8747e8f306628443d3c4d73bce0d79e986f5966e)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Disallow `return` statements
  inside `@try`/`@catch`/`@pending` blocks.

  `return` is only valid in the JS setup at the top of a `@{ … }` code block —
  never inside a `@`-directive block. `@if`/`@for`/`@switch` already rejected
  returns; `@try`/`@catch`/`@pending` previously allowed `return <markup>`
  (lowering it into a reactive boundary fallback). They now reject any `return`
  (with or without an argument) with the same
  `Return statements are not allowed inside TSRX templates` diagnostic,
  consistently across every target (ripple, react, preact, solid, vue). Render
  markup by writing it as the block's output instead of returning it. Returns
  inside nested ordinary functions are unaffected.

- [#1269](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1269)
  [`8747e8f`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/8747e8f306628443d3c4d73bce0d79e986f5966e)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Treat plain JS control flow
  inside `@{ … }` as ordinary JavaScript that returns JSX.

  Only `@`-directives (`@if`/`@for`/`@switch`/`@try`) lower to template control
  flow. Plain `if`/`for`/`for…of`/`for…in`/`while`/`do…while`/`switch`/`try`
  inside a code block are now compiled exactly like the same control flow in a
  regular `function C() { …; return <jsx> }` body — their JSX returns become
  `tsrx_element` values rather than being template-ized.

  Previously these plain statements were mis-routed into the template transform:
  on **ripple** an early-return guard produced a `_$_.if`/`_$_.switch`/`_$_.try`
  wrapper (with dead code in the `switch`/`try` cases) and plain loops threw a
  compile error; on **solid** they produced
  `<Show>`/`<Switch>`/`<For>`/`<Errored>` (dropping trailing output for `try`).
  They now stay as plain control flow, so early-return guards and loops behave
  like normal JavaScript.

  As part of this, the ripple client and server targets no longer emit the
  `return_guard` bookkeeping variable: a plain early `return` is a real early
  return, so subsequent template output is naturally skipped without a guard flag.

  On **solid**, this means a plain guard (`if (signal()) return …`) inside a
  component body now runs once at setup — exactly like a regular Solid component —
  instead of being lifted into a reactive `<Show>`. Use `@if` (or another
  `@`-directive) when you want reactive conditional rendering.

### Patch Changes

- [`b104604`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b10460473fec0ee68b4963cbc2a3d9d5bb3bc633)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix descendant and sibling
  selectors being wrongly pruned as unused in the shared JSX targets (react,
  preact, solid, vue).

  Selector pruning for free-standing `<style>` blocks runs before the transform
  walker has stamped ancestor paths onto template nodes, so combinator matching
  (`.card h2`, `.card > ul`) found no ancestors and marked every such selector
  unused. Element collection for pruning now records each element's ancestor chain
  itself, so descendant matching works the same as in the Ripple target.

## 0.1.29

### Patch Changes

- [#1257](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1257)
  [`67de047`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/67de047d103f39673b25910e1a97760278820999)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Lower TSRX-only nodes inside
  expression-position `@{ … }` code blocks. Setup statements of a code block used
  as an expression (e.g. `const Test = @{ … }`) were carried into the generated
  scoped IIFE verbatim without re-visiting them, so a style expression
  (`const styles = <style> … </style>`) or a nested `@{ … }` block inside the
  setup reached the printer as a raw `JSXStyleElement` / `JSXCodeBlock` node and
  failed with "Not implemented: JSXStyleElement". The lowered scope is now
  re-visited the same way function-body code blocks are, so style expressions
  compile to their class maps (with the CSS emitted) and nested blocks lower into
  their own scopes.

- [#1262](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1262)
  [`1c645c8`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/1c645c8f854df23bb1271b3402d1885616b525cd)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Prune unreachable selectors
  from `<style>` blocks consistently across targets.

  For a style expression (`const styles = <style> … </style>`), only standalone
  class selectors — scoped (`.x`) or global-wrapped (`:global(.x)`) — end up in
  the generated class map, but the emitted CSS still contained every selector.
  Top-level selectors that don't contribute a class map entry (element selectors,
  compound selectors, descendant chains, global tag selectors) are now commented
  out as unused, while standalone classes, `:global(.x)` selectors, and rules
  nested inside a reachable rule (e.g. `&:hover`) are kept.

  Free-standing `<style>` blocks in the shared JSX targets (react, preact, solid,
  vue) now prune selectors that match no element, the same way the Ripple target
  always has, instead of keeping every authored selector. Selector matching also
  recognizes `className` as the class attribute for React-style targets.

- [#1260](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1260)
  [`b1256fd`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b1256fdb5bf279ee7dd20bf1a71dcfccc47e279c)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Make style scope hashes
  unique per style block and per file. The hash was derived from the style block's
  content alone, so two `<style>` blocks with identical CSS — in different
  components of the same file, or in different files — collided and shared a
  scope. The hash input now includes the filename and the line/column where the
  `<style>` tag starts. Because the filename may be an absolute path, the hash
  also switched from the reversible djb2 hash to the truncated SHA-256 hash so
  file structure can't be recovered from class names in the shipped bundle.

  The `filename` parameter of `parse`, `parseModule`, and the per-target `parse`
  wrappers is now required (typed as a non-empty string), and parsing a `<style>`
  element without one throws a clear error instead of silently seeding the hash
  with an empty name. The prettier plugin and eslint parser pass their host's file
  path through, falling back to a plugin-specific placeholder when formatting or
  linting in-memory text.

## 0.1.28

### Patch Changes

- [#1255](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1255)
  [`f001849`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/f00184940979a77cbf6873a811caaaa436feab46)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Always parse `@{ … }` in
  template text position as a `JSXCodeBlock`. A code block preceded by text on the
  same line (e.g. `Hello @{props.username}`) was split into JSX text ending in a
  literal `@` plus a `{ … }` expression container, because the template raw-text
  scan only stopped at `<`, `{`, `}`, and control-flow directives. The scan now
  also stops at a `@{` code-block start, so inline blocks after text parse the
  same as blocks at the start of a body. A lone `@` not directly followed by `{`
  remains plain text.

- [#1254](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1254)
  [`4af2591`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/4af259139d118a27d177531aa6a21435a3f3a015)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix `@{ … }` code blocks in
  template children position for the shared JSX transform (react, preact, solid,
  vue). Nesting deeper than two levels leaked a raw code block into the statement
  stream — triggering spurious `_tsrx_child_*` captures and an IIFE whose render
  output was discarded (dropped in react/preact, rendered out of position in
  solid) — and flattened blocks merged lexical scopes, so shadowed declarations
  produced invalid output. Each block is now its own scope and the lowering pays
  only for what the block uses: template-only blocks merge statically into the
  parent, code-only blocks become a plain `{ … }` statement block, blocks with
  both setup code and render output become a scoped IIFE child, and nested chains
  fold into a single closure with nested plain blocks. Empty chains compile to
  nothing at any depth.

- [`87afc5d`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/87afc5d3f4c73e604cd245865e27d29e40435482)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Keep native template nodes in
  JSX-child shape inside synthetic fragments on JSX-emitting targets (react,
  preact, solid, vue). A fragment nested in an expression container could collapse
  to a bare expression placed directly in a fragment children list
  (`<>{a} <>{<>{b}</>}</></>` compiled to `<>{a}b</>`), which JSX reads as literal
  text — in both production output and the TS/Volar virtual code.

- [`87afc5d`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/87afc5d3f4c73e604cd245865e27d29e40435482)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Parse template text that
  touches a following tag (`<>hello<span>…`) as text plus a tag. The tokenizer
  treated a `<` directly after a text run ending in an identifier character as the
  start of a TypeScript type-argument list (`hello<T>`), so the tag failed to
  parse with "Unexpected token `>`".

- [#1256](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1256)
  [`f1a4c10`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/f1a4c10d2ad8ed604375f36f7ae3b653fe95ed1a)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Recognize trailing `//` line
  comments in template text after a sibling on the same line. A `//` was only a
  comment when nothing but whitespace preceded it on its line, so
  `@{ … }  // note` (or an element/expression container followed by a trailing
  comment) treated the comment as text — and crashed with `Unexpected token` when
  the comment contained `<`. A `//` preceded only by whitespace since the start of
  its text run (right after a code block, element, or expression container) now
  starts a comment. `//` after real text on the same line is still literal, so
  `https://…` URLs stay text.

### Patch Changes

- [#1244](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1244)
  [`60a78c9`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/60a78c9def09eed6d706c42bc751d2d051d1d57f)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Strip `/* … */` block
  comments from template text on all targets. The template raw-text scanner only
  recognized line comments, so block comments in text position leaked into
  compiled output (production templates, server output, and to_ts virtual code)
  and, in one position, were both recorded as a comment and kept as text. Block
  comments are now removed from `JSXText` and recorded as comments everywhere, and
  the Prettier plugin prints them back (including before closing tags/fragments
  and in comment-only bodies) instead of relying on the leaked text.

  [`92982ee`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/92982ee5cd2e6d971b5b650ec1df70483c9716aa)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Add parser, formatter, and
  compiler support for `<{expr}>` dynamic element tags.

- [#1241](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1241)
  [`b826234`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b8262342111a977ba5a0d44086154e386b06f4b9)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Treat dynamic tags
  (`<{expr}>`) like the runtime `Dynamic` helper during scoped CSS analysis on all
  targets: type selectors are no longer pruned (the tag can resolve to any
  element), the element's classes match scoped selectors, and the scope hash is
  applied to its class.

- [#1241](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1241)
  [`b826234`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b8262342111a977ba5a0d44086154e386b06f4b9)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Remove the runtime `Dynamic`
  component exports; dynamic rendering is the `<{expr}>` tag syntax. The `Dynamic`
  type declarations remain so type-only output keeps type-checking, but the JS is
  gone: React and Preact production output now lowers dynamic tags to a scoped
  component alias (`const TsrxDynamic_N = expr;`), Ripple SSR uses the internal
  `_$_.dynamic_element` helper, and the imported-`Dynamic` detection for scoped
  CSS is removed (the element marking is now `metadata.dynamicElement`, set by the
  dynamic-tag lowering).

- [#1241](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1241)
  [`b826234`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/b8262342111a977ba5a0d44086154e386b06f4b9)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Lower dynamic tags
  (`<{expr}>`) for Solid and Vue production output to scoped component bindings
  instead of the `Dynamic` helper component. Solid binds
  `const TsrxDynamic_N = _tsrx_dynamic(() => expr)` (aliasing `dynamic` from
  `@solidjs/web`); Vue aliases the tag inside an import-free expression-child IIFE
  so vue-jsx-vapor's render block keeps it reactive. Declarations are placed in
  the scope that owns the expression (e.g. inside loop callbacks), and the
  type-only transform keeps the `<TsrxDynamic is={expr}>` shape with source
  mappings for both tag positions.

### Patch Changes

- [`d14ec84`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/d14ec84f26233e514be9e59ffc94e61db5089587)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Preserve whitespace between a
  control-flow directive's closing `}` and the following template text. A bare
  `else` (or any sibling text) after an `@if` block such as `@if (x) { … } else`
  now keeps the leading space instead of dropping it, matching how text after a
  plain element is handled.

- [`921fb9c`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/921fb9ce6485db41527b631f5236b7abbac74986)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix a parser crash ("Invalid
  array length") when a control-flow directive (`@if`/`@for`/`@switch`/`@try`) is
  followed by same-line trailing text that runs straight into the closing tag,
  e.g. `<>@if (a) { … } done</>`. The manual JSX-closing-tag re-entry now restores
  the two tokenizer contexts a real `jsxTagStart` would have pushed, so the
  closing tag no longer underflows the context stack.

  [`6fd49c9`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/6fd49c9dd737e889844e254763f66e13ea4a7241)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Replace the removed `<@...>`
  dynamic tag syntax with runtime `Dynamic` helpers. Ripple now exports `Dynamic`
  and reuses its composite runtime path for dynamic elements/components, while
  React, Preact, Solid, and Vue expose target-specific `Dynamic` helpers with
  typed `is` props.

  React, Preact, Solid, and Vue now mark imported runtime `Dynamic` elements
  during shared JSX analysis so scoped CSS classes are applied through aliases
  without treating local components named `Dynamic` as runtime elements.

  Dynamic component prop forwarding now uses a shared core runtime helper that
  excludes the internal `is` prop without snapshotting getter-backed reactive
  props.

  The TSRX parser, transforms, analyzers, prettier support, and related tests no
  longer recognize dynamic tag syntax. Stale JSX identifier `tracked` plumbing
  from that parser path has also been removed.

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Allow bare `else` text after a
  TSRX `@if` block while continuing to reject missing-`@` continuation clauses,
  and remove `finally` parsing from TSRX `@try` control flow.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Lower bare
  `@if`/`@for`/`@switch`/`@try` control-flow directives that sit directly in a
  call/`new` argument position
  (`func(@if (status === 'active') { … } @else { … })`). For the React, Preact,
  Solid, and Vue targets these previously leaked an untransformed
  `JSXIfExpression`/`JSXForExpression`/`JSXSwitchExpression`/`JSXTryExpression`
  straight to the printer and crashed with "Not implemented: JSX…Expression". The
  argument is now wrapped in a native TSRX fragment before transform, so it flows
  through the same render machinery as an expression-bodied arrow, `return`, or
  assignment output (a `@{ … }` code-block argument already lowered to an IIFE and
  is unchanged).

- [`16560cb`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/16560cb466430bdbe8749d9491bc79e69e58d02c)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Lower bare
  `@if`/`@for`/`@switch`/`@try` control-flow directives that sit directly in an
  expression position — an expression-bodied arrow
  (`const M = (props) => @switch (x) { … }`), a `return @switch (x) { … }`, or
  assignment to a variable (`const view = @switch (x) { … }`,
  `view = @switch (x) { … }`). For the React, Preact, Solid, and Vue targets these
  previously leaked an untransformed
  `JSXSwitchExpression`/`JSXIfExpression`/`JSXForExpression`/`JSXTryExpression`
  straight to the printer and crashed with "Not implemented: JSX…Expression". The
  directive is now wrapped in a native TSRX fragment before transform, so it flows
  through the same render machinery as a component-body output and each platform
  emits its existing lowering (an IIFE+`switch` for React/Preact/Vue,
  `<Switch>`/`<Match>` for Solid).

- [`4be6e54`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/4be6e54bbfee20927adca473648a94aa173d7d77)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Parse `@{ … }` code blocks
  and `@if`/`@for`/`@switch`/`@try` control-flow directives inside an element
  nested in a `{ … }` expression container (e.g. `{<div>@if (x) { … }</div>}`,
  including in `.map()` callbacks). These previously crashed with "RangeError:
  Invalid array length": the directive parser strips JSX tokenizer contexts so its
  body parses as JS, and inside an expression container it also stripped the
  container's and enclosing element's contexts, underflowing the context stack
  when the surrounding markup closed. The directive filter now preserves every
  context below the innermost expression-container baseline, matching the bare
  `function … @{ … }` form.

- [`2b67f83`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/2b67f83d7ed7eab7a39bc33524fcf73f737d977e)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Parse ternaries whose
  branches are JSX elements or fragments with children inside a `{ … }` expression
  container (e.g. `{cond ? <div>a</div> : <span>b</span>}`, including nested
  ternaries, fragment branches, and ternaries in attribute values or `.map()`
  callbacks). A JSX branch left the tokenizer at `exprAllowed === false`, so the
  `<` after the `:` was not recognized as a tag start and parsing failed with
  "Unexpected token". Expression position is now restored after a JSX ternary
  branch so the alternate parses as JSX too.

- [`9918c52`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/9918c52e954f2b8e1a994892e7c555e8277f2d59)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Keep ordinary JavaScript
  control-flow blocks from implicitly rendering bare TSRX templates while
  preserving Solid terminal branch lowering.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Preserve leading whitespace
  in JSX text children of elements nested inside `{ … }` expression containers.
  The JSX-expression reader skipped leading whitespace before anchoring the
  JSXText token, so `{<textarea>   a</textarea>}` lost its indentation while the
  bare `<textarea>   a</textarea>` kept it. Both paths now capture text
  identically, so every target (Ripple, React, Preact, Solid, Vue, including
  `typeOnly`/`to_ts` output) emits consistent JSX text.

- [`c424675`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/c424675102a9edd4f1e356fb6db30124a9c2d885)

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Fix line-tracking desync when a
  code-block setup statement following a render node is mis-read as JSX text.
  Re-reading the statement now rewinds the line counter along with the position,
  so node `loc` lines stay correct and source-map mapping no longer crashes

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Allow a trailing `;` after the
  render node of a `@{ }` code block or directive body (e.g. `<>…</>;`). The stray
  semicolon is a meaningless empty statement and is now skipped during parsing
  instead of being captured as a statement after the render output. This
  previously produced a "statements cannot follow the rendered output" diagnostic
  and, because the render node was then mis-bucketed as a body statement, could
  crash the transformer with "Not implemented: JSXStyleElement" when the output
  contained a `<style>` element. Prettier still strips the semicolon on format.

  "Unexpected character '@'" before the code block could be recognized. The return
  type is now parsed before the body is inspected, and `@` is tokenized in type

### Patch Changes

- [#1177](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1177)
  [`054bd1e`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/054bd1e75347e395f6c096f8e293d1baf8e03549)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Parse tags and bare fragments
  as native TSRX by default, remove `component` keyword parsing, and
  compile/format/lint function components that return native TSRX across the
  React, Preact, Solid, Vue, and Ripple targets. Ripple component compilation now
  only renders TSRX reachable from returned values and supports string and `null`
  component returns.

  Ripple now also preserves directly called PascalCase helpers as ordinary
  functions while still compiling renderable component functions used as
  components or render entries.

  The old explicit TSRX wrapper tag is no longer special; TSRX elements and
  fragments are the default expression syntax, and the tag name is treated like
  any ordinary element name.

  Ripple now exports a typed `Fragment` helper from its public runtimes and
  supports `innerHTML` on both host elements and `Fragment`. Ripple also treats
  `innerHTML` from element spreads as rendered content instead of serializing it
  as an `innerhtml` attribute.

  The `{html ...}` template directive has been removed. Use each target's native
  raw HTML prop instead, such as `innerHTML` for Ripple/Solid/Vue or
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` for React/Preact.

  The `{text ...}` template directive has also been removed. Text values now use
  ordinary `{expr}` containers, with explicit coercion written as JavaScript
  (`String(value)`, `value + ''`, or a typed string value). Ripple optimizes
  clearly string-shaped expressions and typed string props into text-node updates
  without requiring a TSRX-specific directive.

  [`de27e18`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/de27e182d002ea736aee992acca4cbf9873a307d)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Drop the
  continuation/tail-helper lift for hook-bearing `if`, `switch`, `try`, and
  `for-of` blocks in React and Preact output. The pattern existed to forward
  post-hook mutations through to statements after the control-flow construct, but
  the hook-callback-outer-mutation and hook-result-outer-assignment validations
  make those mutations unreachable. The hook-bearing branch is still wrapped in
  its own `StatementBodyHook` helper to satisfy Rules of Hooks; trailing
  statements now stay in the parent component instead of being lifted into a tail
  helper. For-of helpers no longer thread an `_tsrx_isLast_*` prop or emit an
  empty-source fallback. Output is smaller and easier to read with no behavior
  change for valid programs.

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Compile `for ... of` in React
  and Preact components through a new `map_iterable` runtime helper instead of an
  inline `Array.isArray(src) ? src : Array.from(src)` normalization followed by
  `.map(...)`. Both the non-hook and hook-bearing lowerings now emit a single
  `map_iterable(source, (item, i) => ...)` call that accepts any `Iterable` —
  `Set`, `Map`, generators, and other iterators — without copying arrays. The
  helper is imported from a new target-namespaced subpath: `@tsrx/react/runtime`
  for React output and `@tsrx/preact/runtime` for Preact output, both of which
  re-export from `@tsrx/core/runtime`, so end-user projects only need the target
  package installed. Loop-scoped TS types in editor-tooling (non-module-scoped
  helper) output reference the new `IterationValue<T>` helper so destructured
  `Map` entries and other non-array sources type-check correctly.

  [`1256569`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/12565695efaa3a4ad429245807721ea671c2ecb5)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Allow native TSRX template

  brace while reporting an editor diagnostic.

- [#1112](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/1112)
  [`18b4aef`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/18b4aefa8127e56a9f1b3058da2d4d2172551579)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Support JavaScript `switch`
  fall-through semantics in component templates across the React, Preact, Solid,
  and Vue targets. When a `case` body has no `break` (or terminal `return`), each
  entry case now renders its own body plus every downstream body it would have
  fallen into — matching JS spec and the existing Ripple runtime behavior.

  All four targets reuse the same `create_hook_safe_helper` lift that hook-bearing
  case bodies already go through, orchestrated by a shared `plan_switch_lift`
  planner exported from `@tsrx/core`. Any case body that appears in more than one
  arm after fall-through analysis is hoisted into its own `StatementBodyHook`
  helper component, and each upstream arm chains into the next helper at the end
  of its body. Each case body therefore appears exactly once in the generated
  module regardless of how many arms reach it, keeping bundle size linear in case
  count and source mappings 1:1 for editor IntelliSense. Cases that terminate with
  `break` (or aren't reached via fall-through) stay inline as before.
  - **React, Preact, Vue** keep the JS `switch` and emit case arms that
    `return <Helper/>` for lifted bodies; inline arms append `<NextHelper/>` as
    the chain entry point.
  - **Solid** lowers each entry case to a `<Match>` whose body is the lifted
    helper element, or for inline arms a fragment of the inline JSX plus a chain
    `<NextHelper/>`.

  Vue's and Solid's client transforms now hoist all `StatementBodyHook` helpers —
  not just the fall-through ones — to module scope (Vue wraps each in
  `defineVaporComponent`). Every control flow that already went through the lift
  on React (hook-bearing `if`, `switch`, `try`, and `for-of` bodies) now produces
  a single top-level helper instead of a per-render lazy initializer.
  `compile_to_volar_mappings` opts back out via
  `moduleScopedHookComponents: false` so Volar's virtual TSX keeps helpers local —
  closure-captured bindings stay resolvable against the component body for type
  checking.

  Create map helper functions for for-of loops to be used in the future transforms

  [`3e84758`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/3e847588027d6254c3999a87c717e9d58fb55a26)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Tighten hook outer-binding
  validator around `for…of`:
  - A non-declaration target (`for (x of items)`) was being treated as a local
    declaration, hiding later hook-result assignments to the same outer binding.
  - `let`/`const` declared by a for-of (`for (const x of items)`) was likewise
    being added to the _enclosing_ block's shadowed set, even though the binding
    is scoped to the loop in JavaScript. This let after-loop assignments to a
    same-named outer binding (e.g.,
    `for (const x of items) { … } [x] = useState(0)`) escape detection.
    Loop-declared names are now scoped to the body sub-tree only.
  - The for-of's own iteration assignment was not inspected at all, so iterating a
    hook-derived value into an outer binding (e.g., `for (x of useState(0))` or
    `for ([a, b] of [useState(0)])`) silently lost the rebind in the emitted code.

  All three shapes now report the same diagnostic as a direct hook-result

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Stop emitting a duplicate
  source mapping for the synthesized attribute name when shorthand JSX attributes
  (`<X {count} />`) are expanded to longhand (`<X count={count} />`). The

  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Collect transform-time errors
  instead of throwing in loose mode for the JSX targets (React, Preact, Solid,

  `<tsx:kind>` mismatches, multiple `ref={...}` attributes, malformed `try`
  blocks, fragment-as-element, `for await...of`) now push onto `result.errors` so
  the typescript-plugin and other editor tooling can surface them as diagnostics
  on top of a still-valid virtual TSX, mirroring how `@tsrx/ripple` already
  behaves.

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Keep double-quoted JavaScript

  [`bce43be`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/bce43be304812ca04dd8d196e2439f28ea392237)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Compile-time merge for
  multiple ref expressions, plus a diagnostic for duplicate `ref={...}`
  attributes.

  **New rule**: an element may have at most one TSX-style `ref={...}` attribute.
  Multiple `ref={...}` on the same element is now a compile error — they would
  otherwise produce duplicate JSX props (last-wins at runtime, can't be typed
  cleanly). The error suggests the supported alternative.

  **Multiple `{ref expr}` keyword-form refs are still supported and merge into one
  ref**:
  - `@tsrx/react`, `@tsrx/preact`, and `@tsrx/vue` emit
    `ref={mergeRefs(a, b, ...)}`, importing the shared `mergeRefs` helper from
    `@tsrx/react/merge-refs`, `@tsrx/preact/merge-refs`, and
    `@tsrx/vue/merge-refs` respectively. The helper supports function refs,
    React-style `{ current }` ref objects, and Vue-style `{ value }` ref objects
    (e.g. from `ref()` / `useTemplateRef()`), and composes React 19 cleanup return
    values.
  - `@tsrx/solid` emits `ref={[a, b, ...]}`, which Solid's runtime iterates
    natively.

  A single `ref={...}` may be combined with any number of `{ref expr}` on the same
  element — they all merge together. Single-ref elements (either syntax) emit
  unchanged with no helper import.

  `@tsrx/vue` previously merged multiple `{ref expr}` into an inline arrow
  callback that only worked for function refs. Vue now uses the shared `mergeRefs`
  helper, which fixes Vue ref-object handling (`ref()` / `useTemplateRef()`) and
  the previously-broken combo case (`<el ref={a} {ref b} />`).

  [`f660969`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/f66096972bc8d2f03061e6018d03e40207761aaa)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Fix Vue early-return lowering
  so continuation-local refs stay stable across parent updates.

  Also make `if (cond) return;` early returns in Vue components reactive after
  mount. Previously the early return was emitted as a setup-time `if` block, which
  only evaluated `cond` once when `setup()` ran and never again — so flipping the
  condition after mount didn't toggle the continuation.

  The lowering now picks one of two paths based on the continuation:
  - **Pure JSX continuation** — inlined as a render-time ternary
    (`cond ? null : <continuation/>`). Cheapest path, no extra component.
  - **Continuation with setup-time statements** (`provide`, `watch`,
    `watchEffect`, declarations, plain function calls, etc.) — moved into a
    `StatementBodyHook` helper component whose setup runs only when the helper
    mounts. This keeps those statements scoped to the continuation's lifecycle so
    e.g. `provide` is only visible to descendants while the continuation is
    active.

  React, Preact, and Solid lowering is unchanged: their bodies re-run on every
  render, so the existing setup-time `if` already behaves reactively.

  [`7529e1f`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/7529e1fe3f0870319bd3399501fd2eb43c516065)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Fix source-map and Volar
  mapping coverage for one-line early-return `if` statements in shared JSX
  transforms, including plain functions and class-like method bodies.

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- [`7f59ed8`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/7f59ed80d7b44c847fb9eb8bf00d4fe9835c3136)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Replace `node:crypto` usage
  in the compiler with a pure-JS implementation so Ripple can be compiled inside
  browser workers (e.g. the Monaco-based playground) where `crypto.createHash` is
  not available.

  The hashing utility is split into two functions:
  - `simple_hash` — fast non-cryptographic djb2 (base36). Used for CSS class-name
    prefixes and runtime `{html}` hydration markers where the input is user
    content and the output multiplies across the shipped bundle.
  - `strong_hash` — preimage-resistant SHA-256 prefix (pure-JS via
    `@noble/hashes`). Used everywhere a hash is derived from a server-only
    filesystem path (`#server` RPC ids, `track`/`trackAsync` ids, head-element
    hydration markers) so the hash can't be inverted to reveal the original path.

  The runtime `ripple` package no longer ships its own `hashing.js` — it
  re-exports `simple_hash`/`strong_hash` from `@tsrx/core`, and the compiler emits
  `_$_.simple_hash` (previously `_$_.hash`) for dynamic `{html}` hydration
  markers.

### Patch Changes

- [#931](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/931)
  [`4543794`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/45437944a99decfb4bc56f7171772614a7f5691a)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Extract JSX-emitting targets
  into a shared `createJsxTransform` factory in `@tsrx/core`; React, Preact, and
  Solid now plug in via a `JsxPlatform` descriptor so source-mapping fixes
  propagate to all three targets.
  - `@tsrx/core` adds the `createJsxTransform` factory, `JsxPlatform` /
    `JsxPlatformHooks` / `JsxTransformResult` types, and a shared test harness at
    `@tsrx/core/test-harness/source-mappings`. The source-map segments walker now
    handles `TSTypePredicate` and uses strict mapping lookups throughout.
  - `compile_to_volar_mappings` no longer crashes on common AST shapes across all
    three targets: `NewExpression`, `ReturnStatement`, `ForStatement` /
    `ForInStatement`, `TemplateLiteral`, `TaggedTemplateExpression`,
    `AwaitExpression`, computed `MemberExpression`, empty / non-empty
    `ObjectExpression`, class methods (including async, get / set, static) and
    object method shorthand, TS generics, type predicates (`x is T` and
    `asserts x is T`), as-expressions, union / array type annotations,
    self-closing JSX, element attribute spread, and `JSXExpressionContainer`
    inside `<tsx>` blocks.
  - `<tsx>` / `<>` single-child unwrapping is now JSX-context-aware:
    `return <tsx>{'x'}</tsx>` compiles to `return 'x';` rather than invalid
    `return {'x'};`, while `<b><>{111}</></b>` still preserves the inner `{111}`
    container.
  - Class methods no longer crash source-map collection (every function-like node
    gets `metadata` defaulted).

  [`4543794`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/45437944a99decfb4bc56f7171772614a7f5691a)
  Thanks [@leonidaz](https://github.com/leonidaz)! - Fix scoped CSS application
  for elements rendered inside `<tsx>...</tsx>` and bare `<>...</>` fragment
  shorthand so they receive the same hash-based classes as regular template
  elements.

  [`4292598`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/42925982e88f48f0af6cc74deeaa3c17bc6657cf)
  Thanks [@RazinShafayet2007](https://github.com/RazinShafayet2007)! - fix:

  [`e4b5555`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/e4b5555fb5b1651a2bf1bf232565c7e0e40213b8)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Allow bare `<>...</>` fragments
  everywhere TSRX accepts `<tsx>...</tsx>`, including template bodies and
  expression position. The shorthand now compiles across Ripple, React, Preact,
  and Solid targets, while the explicit `<tsx>...</tsx>` form remains supported.

### Patch Changes

- [#899](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/899)
  [`fab49f7`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/fab49f7da8ec13c981f1c7b3102703d0c349fc1e)
  Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Lift the JSX
  hoist-safety predicates (`isStaticLiteral`, `isHoistSafeExpression`,
  `isHoistSafeJsxChild`, `isHoistSafeJsxAttribute`, `isHoistSafeJsxNode`) into
  `@tsrx/core`. `@tsrx/react` and `@tsrx/preact` now share a single
  implementation, so future targets (and bug fixes) no longer need to duplicate
  the logic.

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Fix parser handling of
  line-start `<` comparisons inside template statement element children so they
  are not misparsed as JSX tags.

### Patch Changes

- [#893](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/pull/893)
  [`d027c6c`](https://github.com/Ripple-TS/ripple/commit/d027c6c84fd3ba7c577c52b9fdade77e7ff886e0)
  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Fix parser crash when a JS
  statement inside an element template body has no trailing whitespace before the
  closing tag (e.g. `<ul>var a = "123"</ul>`). The tokenizer previously misread
  `</` as a less-than operator followed by a regexp.

  Thanks [@trueadm](https://github.com/trueadm)! - Extract compiler into
  `@tsrx/core` and `@tsrx/ripple` packages
  - `@tsrx/core`: Core compiler infrastructure — parser factory, scope management,
    utilities, constants, and type definitions
  - `@tsrx/ripple`: Ripple-specific compiler — RipplePlugin, analyze,
    client/server transforms
  - Remove compiler source code from `ripple` package (consumers should use
    `@tsrx/ripple`)
  - Migrate eslint-plugin type imports to `@tsrx/core/types/*`
  - Remove unused compiler dependencies from `ripple` package
